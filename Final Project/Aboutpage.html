                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>My name is Alex Siegel and I am a rising fifth-year computer science student at Georgia State University. I have been programming since my senior year of high school and I have a passion for problem-solving and creating programs. I have developed a strong work ethic throughout my college career and will tackle any problem that comes my way. In my free time, I enjoy playing music, video games, hiking, and watching TV. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
                        <p>Music has been a huge factor in my life for as long as I can remember. Although I am no longer studying music in college, I still partcipate in my university's bands regularly and practice on a daily basis. I enjoy performig and listening to music. As I developed this website, I wanted to share some of my favorite trombone tunes that I listen to regularly. Music is an essential part of our lives, and many of us rarely have time to sit down and enjoy the beauty of it. Alas, I found a way to bring the creativity and blessing of music to my web programming class. </p>

                        <h3>Technology I Used</h3>
                        <p>This website was designed using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The youtube video and spotify album was imbedded into this website using the HTML iframe tag. Each page in the website corrosponds to a different HTML and CSS file to make the website very readable and easy to edit. PHPMyAdmin was used to control the sign-in system by sending and retrieving data from a database. </p>

                        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                        <p>This class is my first hands-on experience with web programming. Through this class, I learned several programming languages, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. I also learned how front-end programming connects to back-end programming, which will provide much utility in the future. This class was very enjoyable and I am able to use this website as a display of my programming skills. </p>

                        <h3>How can Trombonium help me?</h3>
                        <p>Music is a cure for the soul and can reach many parts of the brain that we normally don't use. The power of music can help us express our emotions when all words are lost. Even better, music is also enjoyable. Take some time to escape from your daily problems and relax while enjoying many different trombone videos.</p>
